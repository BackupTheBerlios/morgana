Pre-Release README for Morgana
=================================


Currently I'm working on cleaning up the source tree and preparing some of
the sources for further development.

You will find the prototype, which was the ground of my diploma thesis, at
ftp://morgana.sourceforge.net/pub/morgana/diploma.tar.bz2 
and some of the new sources at
ftp://morgana.sourceforge.net/pub/morgana/current.tar.bz2
Attention: the latter is very much incomplete and not able to run (I
would even wonder if it compiles).

The things I'll do till I check in may be found in the document manager of
Morgana in the group "drafts".


Target release date: end of september 2000.
