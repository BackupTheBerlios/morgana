IMPORTANT NOTICE
------------------

The current version of Morgana is _not_ functional. I would even wonder if
it compiles.

If you want, you may watch me working at the IPC-Layer. As soon as this is
ready and the demo works again I'll mark that project Alpha and announce
it whereever appropriate...

Till then you might be interested in the last running prototype:
ftp://morgana.sourceforge.net/pub/morgana/diploma.tar.bz2
The text in there is German, so don't wonder too much if you don't
understand it. It's my diploma thesis. ;-)

What is Morgana
----------------

Yet Morgana is a project in its first stages of development. Its aim is to
create a simulator for field of artificial intelligence which can be
abstracted in a connectionistic model - a so called "connection machine".
This includes Neural Networks, parts of Fuzzy theory and some
deterministic (partly iterative) algorithms.

Yet it is "alphaware" so many of the items described in the various
documentation files won't even be visible, not mentioning working. ;-)

More about the stage of the project can be found on its homepage at
http://morgana.sourceforge.net .

Copyright
----------

This Software is protected by the GNU GPL version 2 (or any newer at your
option). See the file COPYING for details.


If you want support for SNNS
-----------------------------

The copyright of SNNS is very restrictive, so we don't distribute it
together with Morgana. However our interface can be linked against version
4.2 of SNNS.

Yet it is not decided whether or when support for SNNS will be dropped.

You may get the sources of SNNS from:
http://www-ra.informatik.uni-tuebingen.de/SNNS/

Build SNNS and be sure it is installed besides Morgana so that you find:
...somedir/morgana
...somedir/SNNS

and configure Morgana with the option --with-SNNS .

Installation
--------------

see the file INSTALL for details.
