<h2>What is Morgana</h2>

Morgana is basically a graphical user interface (GUI) for Neural Network
Simulations. As it develops it will be able to view not only the
"Stuttgart Neural Network Simulator" (SNNS), but also its own Simulation
kernel.<p>

Yet this is an Alpha release. This means that it is unusable in great
parts. If you need reliable tools now - refer to the various tools in the
Distribution of <a href="http://www-ra.informatik.uni-tuebingen.de/SNNS/">
SNNS</a>. If you need it later - please stand by.

<h2>Additionals</h2>

Morgana was initially written as my diploma. It was both: the diplome work
and a great deal in learning how to work with Qt, schedulers and many
other concepts of computing...<p>

It will go on - to regions of code - no man had been before....

<h2>The Name Morgana</h2>

Morgana was the name of an artificial intelligence in the first ShadowRun
trilogy (by Robert N. Charrette).
