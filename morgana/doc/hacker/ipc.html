<h1>What is IPC</h1>

In short: IPC stands for Inter-Process-Communication. Guess what: that
means any kind of communication between different processes. Equal whether
they are instances of the same program or of different programs, and equal
whether they reside on the same host or not.<p>

This includes signals (as in "man 2 kill"), pipes of any flavour or
sockets (local in the file system or over the network. Up to high level
libraries providing some means of remote calling, message passing or
whatever kind of communication.<p>

<h2>How does it relate?</h2>

As you may know: Morgana is split into two parts: client and server. Of
course to work together these parts may have to communicate. Somehow.<p>
