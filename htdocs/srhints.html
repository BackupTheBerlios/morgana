<title>Morgana: ShadowRun Hints</title>
<body>
<h1>Hints for the ShadowRun Fans among Morgana Developers/Users</h1>

[written by <a href="mailto:pandur@users.sourceforge.net">Pandur</a> alias
Konrad Rosenbaum]

<ul>
<li>Morgana is an AI Simulator, but won't be really intelligent for the
next decades...
<li>To be precise: the name is kind of a warning, what we should
<i>not</i> develop here.

<p>
<li>Although someone with the name "Dodger" has a SourceForge-Login, they
didn't meet (yet?)
<li>Nor is Morgana able to fall in love to him (yet???) 
<li>Morgana is not able to control itself (yet/herself?)

<p>
<li>Although my first name is Konrad my family name is not Hutten (and 
will never be!! It's Rosenbaum and I think my current name is beautiful
enough to not change it.)   
<li>I won't work for Renraku
<li>And Pandur is only a Pseudonym...

<p>
<li>Most important: Morgana is a software project and not a ShadowRun
novel.
